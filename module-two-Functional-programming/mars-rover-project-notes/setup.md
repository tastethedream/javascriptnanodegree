## Offline Instructions

We have supplied some of the foundational code for you. So follow these steps to get started:

We'll start with the typical setup - clone this repo and install the dependencies

To clone the repo into the desired location on your local machine:
$ git clone --branch project https://github.com/udacity/nd032-c2-functional-programming-with-javascript-starter.git

For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your dependencies run:
yarn install.

Note: If you donâ€™t have yarn installed globally, follow their installation documentation here according to your operating system.

Next, you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what API endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

In your repo, you will see a .env-example file with a place for your API key. Rename or copy the file to one called .env and enter in your key. Now that you have your key, just remember to add it as a parameter to every request you make to NASA.

Run yarn start in your terminal and go to http:localhost:3000 to check that your app is working. If you don't see something like the screenshot below with a different image, check that your API key is set up correctly.

Remember to commit frequently, use branches, and leave good commit messages! You'll thank yourself later.

Before you submit go to the last Concept - Mars Dashboard and complete the Submission Checklist.

## Online Instructions

Go to the next Concept called Workspace and this is also present in the README.md file in the workspace.

Check that the starter folder is present in />home>workspace>starter.

Run yarn install in your terminal and make sure no error occurs.
In the terminal change directory into the starter directory with the command cd starter, then run yarn start, and make sure no error occurs.

Click the Preview button at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to open a new page/tab with the screenshot below with a different image, check that your API key is set up correctly.

The Workspace should automatically save your update to the file. You can download the starter folder and upload it to your Github to commit frequently, use branches, and leave good commit messages! You'll thank yourself later.
